# Bug B01: Off-by-One Error in Branch Name Parsing

## Severity
**Critical**

## Location
`src/worktreeflow/wtf.py:1490`

## Description
The branch name parsing in the `wt_list()` function has an off-by-one error when extracting the branch name from the worktree list output.

## Current Code
```python
elif line.startswith("branch "):
    current_wt["branch"] = line[17:]  # refs/heads/ prefix
```

## Problem
The comment indicates this should skip "refs/heads/" but the calculation is incorrect. The line format is:
```
"branch refs/heads/main"
```

Where:
- `"branch "` = 7 characters
- `"refs/heads/"` = 11 characters
- Total to skip = 18 characters (not 17)

Using `line[17:]` would result in `"/main"` instead of `"main"`.

## Impact
The `wtf wt-list` command will display branch names with a leading slash (e.g., "/main" instead of "main"), causing confusion and potentially breaking tools that parse this output.

## Proposed Fix
```python
elif line.startswith("branch "):
    current_wt["branch"] = line[7:].replace("refs/heads/", "")
```

Or more explicitly:
```python
elif line.startswith("branch "):
    # Line format: "branch refs/heads/branchname"
    branch_full = line[7:]  # Remove "branch "
    current_wt["branch"] = branch_full.replace("refs/heads/", "")
```

## Test Case
```python
line = "branch refs/heads/main"
# Current (broken): line[17:] = "/main"
# Fixed: line[7:].replace("refs/heads/", "") = "main"
```
